# Steps

Use the **Deploy to IBM Cloud** button **OR** create the services and run locally.

<!--Optionally, add a deploy to ibm cloud button-->

## Deploy to IBM Cloud

[![Deploy to IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/deploy/button.png)](https://cloud.ibm.com/deploy?repository=https://github.com/IBM/watson-banking-chatbot.git)

1. Press **Deploy to IBM Cloud**, and then click **Deploy**.

<!--optional step-->
2. In Toolchains, click **Delivery Pipeline** to watch while the app is deployed. After it's deployed, the app can be viewed by clicking **View app**.
![toolchain pipeline](doc/source/images/toolchain-pipeline.png)

<!--update with service names from manifest.yml-->

3. To see the app and services created and configured for this code pattern, use the IBM Cloud dashboard. The app is named `watson-banking-chatbot` with a unique suffix. The following services are created and easily identified by the `wbc-` prefix:
    * `wbc-conversation-service`
    * `wbc-discovery-service`
    * `wbc-natural-language-understanding-service`
    * `wbc-tone-analyzer-service`

## Run locally

> NOTE: These steps are only needed when running locally instead of using the **Deploy to IBM Cloud** button.

<!-- there are MANY updates necessary here, just screenshots where appropriate -->

1. [Clone the repo](#1-clone-the-repo).
2. [Create Watson services](#2-create-watson-services).
3. [Import the Watson Assistant workspace](#3-import-the-watson-assistant-workspace).
4. [Load the Watson Discovery documents](#4-load-the-watson-discovery-documents).
5. [Configure credentials](#5-configure-credentials).
5. [Run the application](#6-run-the-application).

### 1. Clone the repo

Clone the `watson-banking-chatbot` repo locally. In a terminal, run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IBM/watson-banking-chatbot
```

Weâ€™ll be using the file [`data/assistant/workspaces/banking.json`](data/assistant/workspaces/banking.json) and the folder
[`data/assistant/workspaces/`](data/assistant/workspaces/)

### 2. Create Watson services

Create the following services:

* [**Watson Assistant**](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/assistant)
* [**Watson Discovery**](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/discovery)
* [**Watson Tone Analyzer**](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/tone-analyzer)
* [**Watson Natural Language Understanding**](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/natural-language-understanding)

### 3. Import the Watson Assistant workspace

* Find the Watson Assistant service in your IBM Cloud Dashboard.
* Select the service, and then click **Launch tool**.
* Go to the **Skills** tab.
* Click **Create skill**.
* Click the **Import skill** tab.
* Click **Choose JSON file**, go to your cloned repo dir, and `Open` the workspace.json file in `data/conversation/workspaces/banking.json` (or the old full version in `full_banking.json`).
* Select **Everything**, and click **Import**.

To find the `WORKSPACE_ID` for Watson Assistant:

* Go back to the **Skills** tab.
* Click the three dots in the upper-right corner of the **watson-banking-chatbot** card, and select **View API Details**.
* Copy the `Workspace ID` GUID.
  ![view_api_details](doc/source/images/view_api_details.png)

*Optionally*, to view the assistant dialog, select the workspace and choose the
**Dialog** tab. Here's a snippet of the dialog:

![dialog](doc/source/images/dialog.PNG)

### 4. Load the Watson Discovery documents

Launch the **Watson Discovery** tool. Create a **new data collection**,
and give the data collection a unique name.

> Save the **environment_id** and **collection_id** for your `.env` file in the next step.

Under **Add data to this collection**, use **Drag and drop your documents here or browse from computer** to seed the content with the five documents in `data/discovery/docs`.

### 5. Configure credentials

The credentials for IBM Cloud services (Watson Assistant, Watson Discovery, 
Watson Tone Analyzer and Watson Natural Language Understanding) can be found in the **Services** menu in IBM Cloud
by selecting the **Service Credentials** option for each service.

The other settings for Watson Assistant and Watson Discovery were collected during the
earlier setup steps (``DISCOVERY_COLLECTION_ID``, ``DISCOVERY_ENVIRONMENT_ID``, and
``WORKSPACE_ID``).

Copy the [`env.sample`](env.sample) to `.env`.

```bash
cp env.sample .env
```
Edit the `.env` file with the necessary settings.

#### `env.sample:`

```bash
# Copy this file to .env and replace the credentials with
# your own before starting the app.

# Note: If you are using older services, you may need _USERNAME and _PASSWORD
# instead of _IAM_APIKEY.

# Watson Assistant
WORKSPACE_ID=<add_assistant_workspace>
ASSISTANT_URL=<add_assistant_url>
ASSISTANT_IAM_APIKEY=<add_assistant_iam_apikey>

# Watson Discovery
DISCOVERY_URL=<add_discovery_url>
DISCOVERY_ENVIRONMENT_ID=<add_discovery_environment_id>
DISCOVERY_COLLECTION_ID=<add_discovery_collection_id>
DISCOVERY_IAM_APIKEY=<add_discovery_iam_apikey>

# Watson Natural Language Understanding
NATURAL_LANGUAGE_UNDERSTANDING_URL=<add_nlu_url>
NATURAL_LANGUAGE_UNDERSTANDING_IAM_APIKEY=<add_nlu_iam_apikey>

# Watson Tone Analyzer
TONE_ANALYZER_URL=<add_tone_analyzer_url>
TONE_ANALYZER_IAM_APIKEY=<add_tone_analyzer_iam_apikey>

# Run locally on a non-default port (default is 3000)
# PORT=3000
```

### 6. Run the application

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) runtime or NPM.
1. Start the app by running `npm install`, followed by `npm start`.
1. Use the chatbot at `localhost:3000`.

> Note: The server host can be changed as required in the server.js file, and `PORT` can be set in the `.env` file.

# Sample output

![sample_output](doc/source/images/sample_output.png)

<!--Optionally, include any troubleshooting tips (driver issues, etc)-->

# Troubleshooting

* Error: Environment {GUID} is still not active, retry once status is active

  > This is common during the first run. The app tries to start before the Watson Discovery
environment is fully created. Allow a minute or two to pass. The environment should
be usable on restart. If you used **Deploy to IBM Cloud** the restart should be automatic.

* Error: Only one free environment is allowed per organization

  > To work with a free trial, a small free Watson Discovery environment is created. If you already have
a Watson Discovery environment, this will fail. If you are not using Watson Discovery, check for an old
service thay you might want to delete. Otherwise, use the `.env DISCOVERY_ENVIRONMENT_ID` to tell
the app which environment you want it to use. A collection will be created in this environment
using the default configuration.
